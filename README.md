# Bloodbank


## Project Overview
The **Blood Bank Management System** is a real-time, location-based platform designed to efficiently connect blood donors with recipients. It enhances traditional SMS-based systems by integrating **interactive maps**. The system streamlines the donation process, making it faster, more accessible, and more reliable.

## Features
- **User Registration & Authentication**: Secure sign-up and login for donors, recipients, and administrators.
- **Location-Based Search**: Interactive maps displaying donor locations with real-time GPS tracking.
- **Request Management**: Recipients can create blood requests specifying type, urgency, and location.
- **In-App Communication**: Secure messaging and call integration between donors and recipients.
- **Donation History Tracking**: Keeps records of past donations and eligibility periods.
- **Admin Dashboard**: Platform management, user verification, and data security controls.

## Technologies Used
### Front-End:
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript (for UI design)

### Back-End:
- PHP (for server-side logic)
- XAMPP (for local development and testing)

### Database:
- MySQL (for data storage)



## System Architecture
The system follows a **three-tier architecture**:
1. **Presentation Layer**: Web UI built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
2. **Business Logic Layer**: PHP scripts for handling authentication, request matching, and notifications.
3. **Data Access Layer**: MySQL database for managing donor/recipient records and blood bank data.
